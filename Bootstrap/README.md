## Bootstrap Overview

Bootstrap is a comprehensive toolkit for web development, offering a grid system, components, and utilities that simplify the process of creating responsive designs. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Bootstrap provides a foundation that helps developers create web pages more efficiently.

The grid system in Bootstrap dynamically adjusts to the screen size, ensuring a seamless user experience on any device. This project was born out of a need for consistency and efficiency at Twitter, originally known as Twitter Blueprint and sometimes referred to as Twitter Bootstrap.

## Bootstrap Concepts

In this project, we focus on four main concepts of Bootstrap:

### Bootstrap Containers
Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using the default grid system. Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them.

### Bootstrap Grid System
The Bootstrap Grid System is the mechanism in Bootstrap that allows you to structure your HTML content in a responsive and mobile-first manner. It is built with flexbox and allows up to 12 columns across the page.

### Bootstrap Components
Bootstrap Components are a wide range of reusable components such as dropdowns, navigation bars, and badges. They are fully styled and functional out of the box, each serving its own semantic purpose.

### Bootstrap Utilities
Bootstrap Utilities are a set of classes that you can use to further style and shape your web page. They include classes for padding, margin, positioning, color schemes, and more.

## Project Requirements
